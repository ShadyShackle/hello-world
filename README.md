# hello-world

Hey, Person!

I'm working on strengthening my coding skills to dive into the field of game developement, so I hope to focus on C++ and C# as those are the coding languages of the core engines of game developemnt. C# for the indie scene and C++ for AAA dev. My focus is on dame design and mechanics and player interaction. My dream is to make games that inspire players, that emotionally impact them, that make them stare in the mirror and have them coming back to that momment again and again and what it means to them. Wish me luck!
